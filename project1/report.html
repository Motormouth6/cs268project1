        <h2>Critique(from a band member)</h2>
            <p>The home page is a nice summary of what the site has to offer, and it is nice and simplistic; no unnecessary clutter. The about page gives a great description of our group with what we do. Each band member has a unique biography that gives the site visitor a good idea of what that member is like and what the contribute to the band. The music page has just what it needs: the single 'Complain' right there in the middle of the page. The merch tab is a bit bland, but what matters is that the shirts are displayed to the viewer. The contact page is slick, and fits well with the rest of the site's aesthetic. Very happy with how the site turned out, and the style of the overall site blends well with the band's aesthetic.</p>
