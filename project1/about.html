        <p>Have you ever been upset and wanted to write a song about it? That's exactly what Properly Grounded has done
            with 100% of their songs, guaranteed! Angsty teenagers writing pop-punk songs about depression, anxiety,
            heartbreak, and class struggles is a great way to describe PG. </p>
        <p>Between Austin High's love for Green Day, Mayday Parade, and My Chemical Romance, Billy Lipoff's love for
            Rise Against, NOFX, and Anti-Flag, and Josh Campbell's love for Attila, Crown the Empire, and Falling In
            Reverse, you'll find a pretty sweet blend of tons of different styles. </p>
        <p>All in all, these guys are a lot of fun to both see perform and also hang just out with. A bunch of sad, but
            fun loving dudes is what the kids these days would call #relatable. B)</p>
