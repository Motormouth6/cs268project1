        <p>Have you ever been upset and wanted to write a song about it? That's exactly what Properly Grounded has done
            with 100% of their songs, guaranteed! Angsty teenagers writing pop-punk songs about depression, anxiety,
            heartbreak, and class struggles is a great way to describe PG. </p>
        <p>Between Austin High's love for Green Day, Mayday Parade, and My Chemical Romance, Billy Lipoff's love for
            Rise Against, NOFX, and Anti-Flag, and Josh Campbell's love for Attila, Crown the Empire, and Falling In
            Reverse, you'll find a pretty sweet blend of tons of different styles. </p>
        <p>All in all, these guys are a lot of fun to both see perform and also hang just out with. A bunch of sad, but
            fun loving dudes is what the kids these days would call #relatable. B)</p>

                <p class="about-bio">Billy is the one always playing too fast and riffing when nobody asked. With a wide range of influences from classical, to metal and almost everything in between, he’ll write a jazz chart one day and a hip hop beat the next. The shows he goes to, however, are almost exclusively his two favorites, punk and metal.</p>

                <p class="about-bio">Andrew is definitely the most responsible person of this chaotic group. He’s a classic case of a guitar player forced to play bass because we needed a bassist (sorry!), but he’s damn good at it. An all-around reliable and talented dude with a lot of jazz training, he’s a great fit  in our band.</p>
